# Scraping and Optimization
Web scraping is the process of obtaining data from a set of web pages and saving them locally on your computer. It will allow you to automatically load and extract data from multiple pages of websites as per your requirement. Scrapers are usually custom built for a specific website, or can be configured to work with any website.
